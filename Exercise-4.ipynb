    "\n",
    "Exercise 4 includes a **written assignment** (10 points), a **programming assignment with 2+1 problems** (9 points) and a **feedback/workload assessment assignment** (1 point). For each problem you need to modify the notebook by adding your own programming solutions or written text. Remember to save and commit your changes locally, and push your changes to GitHub after each major change! Regular commits will help you to keep track of your changes (and revert them if needed). Pushing your work to GitHub will ensure that you don't lose any work in case your computer crashes (can happen!).\n",

    "## Problem 2 - Create an animation based on the movements (4 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, the objective is to **i)** reduce the number of observations by downsampling our data (i.e. only keeping a record every 10 seconds) and **ii)** create an animation out of our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task 2.1.** To downsample the data, you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First downsample the GPS observations stored in the `selected` GeoDataFrame which you created in previous step in **Task 1.5**: \n",
    "   - For doing this, use the `downsample_GPS_observations()` function provided to you in the **Helper functions**. Read the function description to understand how it works and what parameters you need to use.\n",
    "   - You should downsample the data in a way that one observation per every 10 seconds is kept. You can specify the sampling rate with `sampling_interval` parameter.\n",
    "   - The sampling interval is passed as a text following the so called \"Frequency String\" format as described in the `DateOffsets` table in [pandas documentation which you can read from here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/timeseries.html#dateoffset-objects).\n",
    "   - Downsampling is based on groups of GPS observations which are selected from the data based on `\"vehicle_id\"` and `\"direction_id\"`. This means that the function will split the data where individual trajectory for a given vehicle and to given direction will be downsampled (such a metro from Tapiola to Mellunmäki or vice versa). You can use the `grouping_columns` variable (a list) and pass it to the `group_by_columns` parameter. \n",
    "   - Store the results in a variable called `downsampled`. This GeoDataFrame should contain the same attributes as the `selected` GeoDataFrame, but much fewer records (as only 1 record per 10 seconds is kept).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a copy of the `downsampled` GeoDataFrame and store it into a new variable `visualization_data`.\n",
    "3. Reset the index of the `visualization_data` GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "4. Keep only following columns in the `visualization_data` GeoDataFrame: `\"geometry\", \"speed\", \"timestamp\", \"direction_id\", \"vehicle_id\", \"route_id\"`\n",
    "    - You can select specific columns from a GeoDataFrame by passing a list of columns inside square brackets, such as `gdf[ [\"column1\", \"column2\", \"etc\"] ]`\n",
    "    - Store the results of this selection into a variable `visualization_data` (i.e. we are overwriting the previous content of this variable)\n",

However, the maximum points from this Programming Assignment is still 9 points.*\n",

    "1. Create a new column called `speed_kmph` to the `downsampled` GeoDataFrame into which you should calculate the speed as kilometers per hour.\n",
    "   - Use the column `speed` as the input for this calculation which contains the speed information as a **meters per second**. \n",

Iterate over the trajectories in the `splitted` TrajectoryCollection and use the function `trajectory_points_to_linestring()` provided for you in the Helper functions to convert the individual trajectory into a GeoDataFrame.
